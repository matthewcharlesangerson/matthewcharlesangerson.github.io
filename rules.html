        <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
    <p>
Racquetball is played by two (singles) or four players (doubles). A variation of the game that is played by three players is called cut-throat. In cut-throat, one player serves and the other two players are his/her opponents. If the server wins the rally, they score a point. If they lose the rally, one of the other players becomes the server. The players take turns being the server as each player serving loses a rally.
        <br>
        <br>
The objective is to win each rally by serving or returning
the ball so the opponent is unable to keep the ball in play.
A rally is over when a hinder is called or when a player (or
team in doubles): 1) is unable to hit the ball before it
bounces twice, or 2) is unable to return the ball in such a
way that it touches the front wall before it touches the floor.
<br>
<br>
Points are scored only by the serving side when it serves an
irretrievable server (an ace) or wins a rally. In doubles,
when the first server loses the serve, the second server then
serves. After the second server loses the serve, it is a side
out.
<br>
<br>
A match is won by the first side winning two games. The
first two games of a match are played to 15 points (win by
one point). If each side wins one game, a tiebreaker game
is played to 11 points (win by one point).
<br>
        <br>
The specifications for the standard four-wall racquetball
court are: Dimensions. The dimensions of an indoor court are 20 feet wide, 40 feet long, and 20 feet high. Outdoor courts
may be shorter and without back walls. All surfaces are
in play, with the exception of any gallery opening, and
surfaces designated as out-of-play for a valid reason
(such as being of very different material or not in
alignment with the back wall).
<br>
        <br>
The short line is midway between the front and
back walls. The serve must hit the front wall and then
not bounce before crossing the short line in the air.
Service Line. The service line is five feet in front of the
short line. It is the line closest to the front wall.
        <br>
        <br>
To start playing, you have to decide who will serve first.
You can do this by lagging, coin toss, or any other method
you choose. To serve, the server must drop the ball in the
service zone and hit it after it takes one bounce. The server
gets two chances to put the ball into play. A good serve
means that the ball hits the front wall first and did not hit
more than one other wall before hitting the floor beyond the
short line. Bad serves are called either fault serves or out
serves. If a server commits two fault serves, they lose the
serve, or if they commit one out serve, they lose the serve.
<br>
        <br>
Short Service – the ball does not land over the short line.
3-Wall Serve – the ball hits more than two walls.
Ceiling Serve – the ball hits the ceiling after hitting the
front wall.
Long Serve – the ball hits the back wall before hitting the
floor.
Screen Serve – the ball passes so close to the server’s body
that the receiver cannot see it. The receiver must be in
a good court position to make this call.
<br>
        <br>
Two Consecutive Fault Serves – serving two fault serves as
described above.
Missed Serve Attempt – when the server drops the ball and
swings at it, but completely misses it.
Non-Front Wall Serve – any ball that does not hit the front
wall first.
Out of Court Server – if the ball goes out of the court
before it hits the floor on the serve.
<br>
        <br>
A server is entitled to continue serving until one of the
following occurs:
They hit one Out serve.
They hit two Fault serves in a row.
They fail to keep the ball in play after their opponent’s
return of serve.
<br>
        <br>
All of the lines on the court apply to serve and return of
serve only and do not apply after a good serve has been
returned and the rally has started.
During the rally, opponents take turns hitting the ball to the front wall. Players may hit the ball directly to the front wall, or use any combination of the side wall, back wall, or ceiling, as long as the ball hits the front wall before touching the floor. The non-hitting team must yield the right of way to the hitter, including moving to worse court position if required.
The hitter should stop play whenever they believe
they may injure another player with the ball, racquet
or body. This is called a Replay Hinder, causing the
last rally to be replayed. Penalty hinders are also
called during tournament play. See the full rules for
an explanation of that type of hinder.
<br>
        <br>
A player wins the rally when their opponent does
not make a good return by either:
1) Two Bounce. Opponent could not return the ball
before the second bounce on the floor.
2) Skip Ball. Opponent’s return hit the floor before
touching the front wall.
